# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project for the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This project was created by utilizing Figma. This allowed me to pull the required images and find the corect mark-ups for the layout.

## Introduction

The main focus of this project was for us to build a responive website that would work across multiple screen sizes. It depicts the many places traveled by the explorer, Jacques Cousteau.

## Project features

- Flexbox and Grid displays
- Responsive layout across multiple screen sizes
- The integration of @media rules
- A review of previously learned css styles and html structure
- Implementing fonts

## Plan on improving the project

This project was quite challenging for me personally. I didn't realize how much I depended on the brief and videos to help with layouts. Being able to comb through discord and finding other students with similar issues and the related fixes is a great resource.
